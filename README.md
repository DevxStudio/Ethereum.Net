#Ethereum.NET

A .NET implementation of the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) protocol; a platform for building decentralised applications.

##What?
Whilst the internet is an excellent medium for facilitating communication and collaboration; there is a problem with trust. It's just too easy to lie. Our current model mitigates this by relying on centralised authorities to arbitrate between parties. A few limitations with this model include:

- single point of failure
- single point of control
- may be biased/incompetent/corrupt/untrustworthy themselves

##How?
Ethereum is a platform for building decentralised applications. It avoids centralised authorities by means of cryptographically verified peer consensus. The client provides a [turing complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) language built on top of a generic [blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain).
